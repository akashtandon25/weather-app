This project has been created using react and tailwind-css.

To run the project, make sure you have the latest version of npm and react installed. 
Make sure you have all the dependencies installed mentioned in the package.json file. 
To double check, open the terminal in the project directory and run npm install.
Once all dependencies are installed, run npm start.

This project includes all the funcnalities mentioned in the requirements mail. It fetches weather data from https://www.weatherapi.com.
It includes auto-complete funcnality and handles loading and error states as well.

Please note that there are loads of improvemets that I wish to do with the UI as well as adding of other feathers such as linking to firestore that could store all the weather information from past searches. This is not the final website and I will keep on making improvements to it.
